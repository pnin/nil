I turned 19 this Summer (March to be precise) and I was up for a driving license test. I don’t know about it in other countries, but here in India it’s a serious business and you got to have pretty good driving skills to pass this test (unless you have a fixer). For non-transport vehicles, there are two variants of this test: A two-wheeler license test (For Motorcycle with Gear) and a Four-Wheeler License (For Cars). To ease up things a little, we consider driving a bike or a car whose dimensions and capacity are, you know, smaller compared to the ones we drive on road.

The deadly serpentine track consists of some really steep (geometrical disaster) turns which can surely give you a twinge in the ass (while driving a bike of course).  Now out of curiosity or utter stupidity, my choice of bike was a Royal Enfield Classic.

Talking about its dimensions, the bike is about 2.2 meters long (7.3ft), 0.8 meters wide (2.2ft). Fortunately, it has a power start.

Fast-forward to the result, I can say that I survived the test. It was an automobile-miracle that I could drive this beast and pass the test. For the people who are reading this post and are planning to pass the license test on this bike, I would like to tell them one thing, “Darr ke aage Jeet Hain”.
