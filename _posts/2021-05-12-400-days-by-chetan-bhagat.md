Rating – ⭐⭐⭐

How do I put it? The case that Saurabh and Keshav are working on this time, isn’t as thrilling as the previous ones. There’s the usual North Saas-South Bahu rift (more of a distraction), the plot gets too predictable mid-way. Now CB’s writing style is, fineish, some people like it, some don’t. 400 days definitely can’t be listed in his Top 5 works, or Top 10 for that matter (Oh, just checked his wiki, this is his 10th Fiction, so it is in the Top 10 by default. Let’s hope it doesn’t stay there for long).
