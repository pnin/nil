After being hosted on GitHub Pages for >2 years, this site is now Powered by WordPress. I had not planned to make this shift so soon, as building with Jekyll was simple and nothing can beat the performance of a static site.

This website is currently operating at a $40 loss YoY from domain name renewal. and WP hosting charges. (No plan to monetize the site either – Ads/Subscription)

An archive of all previous posts would be hosted on my GitHub.io soon (my weekend project).

**Update (7/6/2022)** – Moved the blog from [pratiknilange.in](pratiknilange.in) to [pratik.nl](pratik.nl). So there goes another $20/yr. I should seriously refrain from buying any more domains 🤦🏼‍♂️.
